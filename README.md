# iPSF Simulation  

## Overview  
**iPSF Simulation** is a tool designed for simulating the **Instrumental Point Spread Function (iPSF)** in optical systems. It enables researchers and engineers to analyze how optical components affect image quality in various configurations.  

## Features  
- Simulate PSF under different optical conditions  
- Configurable parameters for lens aberrations, wavelengths, and sensor properties  
- Visualize PSF results with built-in plotting functions  
- Efficient computational methods for high-speed simulations  

## Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iPSF-Simulation.git
cd iPSF-Simulation
pip install -r requirements.txt
